# Storied Machine Learning Take-Home Task
Take home task for machine learning candidates

In this repository is a zip file containing 100 image snippets with handwriting. Using a handwriting recognition model of your choice, or one you fine-tune, please execute handwriting recognition for these snippets.

Please use open-source or non-paid models, rather than subscription-based solutions like OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini.

The results should be in a CSV file with the following columns:

- snippet_name
- label (the recognized text)
- confidence_score (a value between 0 and 1, like 0.78)
- If any snippet is blank, itâ€™s fine to leave the label and confidence_score fields empty.

Please commit all code to a public GitHub repository that you can share with us for review.

We know this is a very small amount of data, and the goal is not so much to see how accurate the output is as it is to illustrate your process, how you evaluate and incorporate models, and how you write and structure your code.

Thanks for taking the time to do this, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
